## SemaphoreCI docker-images

This repository's master branch tracks docker images pushed to the official [SemaphoreCI Docker Hub organisation](https://hub.docker.com/u/semaphoreci).

Dockerfiles are built via https://github.com/semaphoreci/dockerfile-renderer, this process is automated which means that this repository is not actively managed or maintained on its own.

If you'd like a tool to be pre-installed you can create an issue in this repo or a Pull Request in https://github.com/semaphoreci/dockerfile-renderer.

More details around how to use our Docker Images can be found in [Custom CI/CD environment with Docker](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/127-custom-ci-cd-environment-with-docker).
