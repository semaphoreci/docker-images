## SemaphoreCI docker-images

This repository's master branch tracks docker images pushed to the official [SemaphoreCI Docker Hub organisation](https://hub.docker.com/u/semaphoreci).

If you'd like a tool to be pre-installed you can create an issue in this repo.

More details around how to use our Docker Images can be found in [Custom CI/CD environment with Docker](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/127-custom-ci-cd-environment-with-docker).
